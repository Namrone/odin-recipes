<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>1lb Italian Sausage</li>
    <li>1 1/2 cup Brown or green lentils</li>
    <li>2 medium Zucchini</li>
    <li>6 cups Low Sodium chicken stock</li>
    <li>1 cup dry white wine (optional)<li>
    <li>1 large onion</li>
    <li>2 celery ribs</li>
    <li>2 medium carrots</li>
    <li>1/4 cup basil leaves</li>
    <li>6 cloves of garlic</li>
    <li>1/2 cup flat leaf parsley</li>
    <li>Parmigiano Reggiano Rind</li>
</ul>

<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Dice 1 large onion, 2 celery ribs, 1 medium zucchini, and 2 medium carrots. Chop 1/4 cup of packed basil leaves and mince 1/2 cup flat leaft parsley and 6 cloves of garlic and set aside.</li>
    <li>Heat a large heavy pot to medium heat with 2 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil and add 1 pound of mild Italian bulk sausage. Cook the sausage until browned while using a spoon or meat masher to break it up into small pieces. Once brown, remove the sausage with a slotted spoon, place on a plate, and set aside</li>
    <li>Add 2 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil to the same pot along with the onion, celery, and carrot. Cook for about 7 minutes, or until soft, stirring occasionally</li>
    <li>Add the zucchini and cook for another 5 minutes, then add the garlic and cook for another 2 minutes, or until fragrant</li>
    <li>Add 1 cup of dry white wine to the pot and turn the heat to high. Use a wooden spoon to scrape the bottom of the pan to dislodge the brown bits</li>
    <li>Once the wine reduces by half (about 2-3 minutes), add the cooked sausage along with 6 cups of low-sodium chicken stock or broth, 2 cups of water, 14 ounces of canned hand-crushed tomatoes, 1 1/2 cups of brown or green lentils, and 1 Parmigiano Reggiano rind and bring the soup to a boil</li>
    <li>Once boiling, lower the heat and cook over a simmer for about 45-50 minutes, or until the lentils are soft. If the soup is too thick, add a touch of water to loosen it up. Once the lentils are tender, remove from the heat and taste test. Adjust salt and pepper as needed, then add the parsley and basil and stir</li>
